# don't use LagBeGone!
I discontinued LagBeGone because there is no need and a way better alternative out there ([NetworkSanity](https://github.com/RequiDev/NetworkSanity)).
LagBeGone has it own problems by breaking Gamemaps, Pooltables, etc.

# LagBeGone
This mod has no need atm, the exploits got fixed by VRChat ^^

Fix for a Lag Exploit for VRChat.
its a dumb way to fix it but works ^^
